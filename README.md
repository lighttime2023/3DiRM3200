# 3DiRM3200
This repository contains the 3DiRM3200 dataset for the paper "R2Net: 2D Deep Residual Learning with Height Embedding for 3D Indoor Radio Map Estimation".

## Dataset
Our 3DiRM3200 dataset consisting of 3,200 3D radio maps, 200 building layout images, 200 furniture layout images and 16 transmitter location images for each building is created. To showcase our 3DiRM3200 dataset, we have now uploaded 32 samples in our 3DiRM3200 dataset, which correspond to 2 building layouts, 2 furniture layouts and 16 transmitters per layout. Our extension of the conference paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology for possible publication. The dataset and codes will be fully available once the paper is accepted.
