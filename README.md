# 3DiRM3200
This repository contains the 3DiRM3200 dataset for the paper "A 2D Deep Residual Learning Approach for 3D Indoor Radio Map Estimation (IEEE ICC 2024)".

## Dataset
Our 3DiRM3200 dataset consisting of 3,200 3D radio maps, 200 building layout images, 200 furniture layout images and 16 transmitter location images for each building is created. We have now added 32 samples in our 3DiRM3200 dataset for illustration, which contain 2 building layouts, 2 furniture layouts with 16 transmitters per layout and corresponding 32 3D radio maps. Our extension of the conference paper has been submitted to IEEE TCOM. The dataset will be fully available once the paper is accepted.
